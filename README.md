# LibraryManagement

## About
  This is embedded development project created for library management with IT standards.

## Language And Methodology
  * CPP
  * OOPS

## Features and Understanding of Code
  * Authentication Module - This module authenticates user by getting username and password from user. And if you want to register yourself     for the application, then it gets username and password from you and add you to username's list.
    For storing and retrieving username and passwords , I have used map from C++ STL.
  * Validation Module - This module accepts Aadhar Card , Contact Number , Book Isuue date , DOB and Email Ids.
    And validates them , Is the input given is correct or not. Like for Aadhar Card , does the input have 12 digits in it. And for DOB , it     validates like does date exceeds 31 or not , does month exceeds 12 and does year exceeds current Year.
